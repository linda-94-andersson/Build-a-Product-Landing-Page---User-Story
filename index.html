        <h1>Potatoes from the begning!</h1> <br>
        <p> From the <a id="wiki-link" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Potato"> <u>Wiki</u> </a> about potatoes: <br>
            The potato is a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum and is a root vegetable native to the Americas,
            with the plant itself being a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae. <br>
            Wild potato species, originating in modern-day Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from Canada to
            southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans
            independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild
            species traced a single origin for potatoes, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme
            northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago there, from a species
            in the Solanum brevicaule complex. In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous,
            some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.<br>
            Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish.
            Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food
            supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.
            Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different types of potatoes.Over 99% of
            presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of
            south-central Chile. The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region
            and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where
            per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production over
            the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world in
            overall production as of 2018.<br>
            Like the tomato, the potato is a nightshade in the genus Solanum, and the vegetative and fruiting parts of
            the potato contain the toxin solanine which is dangerous for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that
            have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible to human
            health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can
            accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.</p>

        <p> More about the hiostory of the potato from <a id="wiki-link"
                href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_the_potato"> <u>Wiki</u><a>:<br>
                    The potato was the first domesticated vegetable in the region of modern-day southern Peru and
                    extreme northwestern Bolivia between 8000 and 5000 BC. Cultivation of potatoes in South America may
                    go back 10,000 years, but tubers do not preserve well in the archaeological record, making
                    identification difficult. The earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been
                    found at the coastal site of Ancón (central Peru), dating to 2500 BC. Aside from actual remains, the
                    potato is also found in the Peruvian archaeological record as a design influence of ceramic pottery,
                    often in the shape of vessels. The potato has since spread around the world and has become a staple
                    crop in many countries.<br>
                    <br>
                    It arrived in Europe sometime before the end of the 16th century by two different ports of entry:
                    the first in Spain around 1570, and the second via the British Isles between 1588 and 1593. The
                    first written mention of the potato is a receipt for delivery dated 28 November 1567 between Las
                    Palmas de Gran Canaria and Antwerp. In France, at the end of the 16th century, the potato had been
                    introduced to the Franche-Comté, the Vosges of Lorraine and Alsace. By the end of the 18th century
                    it was written in the 1785 edition of Bon Jardinier: "There is no vegetable about which so much has
                    been written and so much enthusiasm has been shown ... The poor should be quite content with this
                    foodstuff." It had widely replaced the turnip and rutabaga by the 19th century. Throughout Europe,
                    the most important new food in the 19th century was the potato, which had three major advantages
                    over other foods for the consumer: its lower rate of spoilage, its bulk (which easily satisfied
                    hunger) and its cheapness. The crop slowly spread across Europe, becoming a major staple by
                    mid-century, especially in Ireland.
